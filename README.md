# 🌀 LLM-Blade: Automatic Wind Turbine Blade Inspection Report Generation

This repository contains the code and results from our study on using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate wind turbine blade inspection reports directly from RGB (visual) and thermal images.

We explore a simple, end-to-end approach where images and structured prompts are passed to multimodal LLMs to generate human-readable inspection summaries.

## 🔍 What This Repository Includes

- ✅ Code for generating structured prompts and interfacing with multimodal LLMs.
- ✅ Preprocessed RGB and thermal image inputs (where permitted).
- ✅ Automatically generated reports for 90 turbine blades using the [Qwen LLM](https://huggingface.co/Qwen).
- ✅ Example system and user prompts used for report generation.
- ✅ A sample evaluation script for organizing reports by turbine and image metadata.
- ✅ Guidelines for reviewing and correcting reports for future fine-tuning.

## 📌 Usage

> Requirements:
- Python 3.8+
- Access to the Qwen LLM (via Hugging Face or other interface)
- `transformers`, `torch`, `Pillow`, and other standard packages

To generate reports from a folder of images:

```bash
python src/run_qwen.py --input_dir ./images/ --output_dir ./reports/
```

Customize the prompts in `prompts/system_prompt.txt` and `prompts/user_prompt_template.txt` as needed.
