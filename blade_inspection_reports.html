<h2>Report for Turbine-10_B</h2>
<div><h3>Inspection Report for Turbine-10_B Rotor Blade</h3>
<h4>Visual Inspection (RGB Images)</h4>
<p><strong>Observed Anomalies or Damage:</strong>
1. <strong>Cracks and Delamination:</strong> Upon close inspection of the RGB images, there appears to be a visible crack or delamination near the leading edge of the blade, particularly noticeable on the right side of the blade. This area shows a slight discoloration and a change in texture compared to the rest of the blade surface.
2. <strong>Erosion:</strong> There is some evidence of erosion on the trailing edge of the blade, indicated by a rougher texture and slight discoloration.</p>
<p><strong>Severity Assessment:</strong>
- The crack/delamination observed near the leading edge could potentially lead to structural integrity issues if left unaddressed. It may compromise the aerodynamic efficiency and could result in increased vibrations.
- The erosion at the trailing edge is less severe but still indicates wear and tear, which can affect the blade's performance over time.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Causes:</strong>
- <strong>Fatigue Failure:</strong> The crack near the leading edge could be due to fatigue from repeated stress cycles caused by wind loads and blade rotation.
- <strong>Corrosion/Erosion:</strong> The trailing edge erosion might be due to environmental factors such as salt spray, moisture, or particulate matter in the air.</p>
<h4>Thermal Inspection (Thermal Images)</h4>
<p><strong>Thermal Anomalies or Hotspots:</strong>
1. <strong>Hotspot Near Leading Edge Crack:</strong> The thermal image shows a hotspot near the area where the crack is observed. This suggests that the crack might be causing localized heating, possibly due to stress concentrations or material degradation.
2. <strong>General Temperature Gradient:</strong> The thermal images indicate a general temperature gradient along the blade, with higher temperatures towards the leading edge and lower temperatures towards the trailing edge. This is typical for rotating blades, but the presence of a hotspot near the crack warrants further investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Severity Assessment:</strong>
- The hotspot near the crack indicates that the blade is experiencing localized heating, which could be indicative of material degradation or structural failure if the crack propagates further.
- The general temperature gradient is within expected limits for a healthy blade, but the hotspot needs to be addressed promptly.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Causes:</strong>
- <strong>Material Degradation:</strong> The hotspot could be due to material degradation around the crack, leading to localized heating.
- <strong>Stress Concentration:</strong> The crack itself could be causing stress concentrations, leading to increased local temperatures.</p>
<h4>Recommendations for Maintenance/Repair Actions:</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Visual Inspection and Crack Monitoring:</strong></li>
<li>Conduct a thorough visual inspection of the blade, focusing on the crack area and the trailing edge.</li>

- Erosion suggests exposure to harsh environmental conditions, which can accelerate material degradation over time.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Maintenance or Repair Actions:</strong>
- <strong>Immediate Crack Repair:</strong> Apply a high-strength epoxy or composite patch to seal the crack and prevent further propagation.
- <strong>Surface Preparation and Coating:</strong> Remove the eroded areas and apply a protective coating to prevent further erosion.
- <strong>Visual Inspection Schedule:</strong> Increase the frequency of visual inspections to monitor the progression of any new cracks or delaminations.</p>
<h4>Thermal Inspection (Thermal Images)</h4>
<p><strong>Thermal Anomalies or Hotspots:</strong>
1. <strong>Hotspot Near Leading Edge:</strong> There is a noticeable hotspot near the leading edge of the blade, which corresponds to the area with visible cracks and delamination. This indicates localized heating, possibly due to stress concentration or material degradation.
2. <strong>General Temperature Distribution:</strong> The temperature distribution across the blade appears relatively uniform, with no significant hotspots elsewhere. However, the hotspot near the leading edge suggests localized issues that need attention.</p>
<p><strong>Severity Assessment and Potential Causes:</strong>
- The hotspot near the leading edge is concerning as it may indicate localized overheating, which could be caused by material degradation, stress concentration, or poor insulation.
- The uniformity of temperatures elsewhere suggests that the rest of the blade is functioning within normal operating parameters.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Maintenance or Repair Actions:</strong>
- <strong>Thermal Imaging Analysis:</strong> Conduct a more detailed thermal analysis to understand the cause of the hotspot and assess the extent of material degradation.
- <strong>Structural Integrity Test:</strong> Perform a structural integrity test to confirm the severity of the crack and delamination.
- <strong>Cooling Measures:</strong> If the hotspot is confirmed to be due to material degradation, consider implementing cooling measures to reduce local temperatures and prevent further damage.</p>
<h4>Implications for Turbine Performance</h4>
